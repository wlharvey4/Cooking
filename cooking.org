** Beef Cuts

*** Cheaper Side

    These inexpensive cuts of beef deliver plenty of meaty flavor
    satisfaction, but they’re much easier on the wallet than some of
    the showier cuts.

    These eight beef cuts are incredibly flavorful, but they’re unique
    and less likely to be spotted in your regular supermarket meats
    section. You may need to ask the butcher if they carry the cut or
    seek out a specialty butcher shop.

     Identified by the 7-shaped bone it contains.  Slow-cook to bring
     out its full, savory flavor.

     This cut of beef is known as the 7-bone steak because it has a
     lot of bones. It comes from the shoulder (the chuck), right
     beside the ribeye. That means it has all the flavor of a ribeye,
     but it has a much lower price tag.

     Cook chuck steaks the same way you would a ribeye: quick sear on
     a grill or cast-iron skillet. Thick-cut chuck steaks can be great
     in a slow-cooker recipe. It has a little more chew than tender
     ribeye, and of course those bones.

      1. Combine marinade ingredients in medium bowl. Place beef
         7-Bone Chuck Steak and 1 cup marinade in food-safe plastic
         bag; turn to coat. Close bag securely and marinate in
         refrigerator 6 hours or as long as overnight, turning

         medium, ash-covered coals. Grill, covered, 12 to 14 minutes
         for medium rare (145°F) to medium (160°F) doneness, turning

         boil. Reduce heat; simmer 10 to 15 minutes or until sauce
         consistency, stirring occasionally.
      4. Cut steak into serving-size pieces. Serve with sauce.

      @@html:<h1>@@Flat Iron@@html:</h1>@@

      Also in the shoulder, you’ll find a fine steak that sits on the
      cow’s shoulder bladers. It may be sold as top blade or flat iron
      steak. The steak is actually two different muscles connected by
      a thick line of gristle. The gristle is often cut away to
      produce two cuts.

      Flat iron steaks are very flavorful and buttery due to some good
      marbling. They behave and taste a lot like the more expensive
      flank steak. Because they’re so tender, you don’t need to do
      much more than grill a flat iron steak and season it with salt
      and pepper, or use a quick spice rub for tacos. This cut of
      steak would be great as a salad topper, too, or served with a
      creamy cauliflower mash and pan sauce.

      @@html:<h1>@@Chuck-Eye Steak@@html:</h1>@@

      This steak is basically a ribeye. In fact, it’s often called the
      “poor man’s ribeye.” It comes from the same part of the cow as
      the prize ribeye, but it’s cut thinner so butchers can get an
      extra piece to sell.

      Cook chuck-eye steaks just like you would a real ribeye. Give it
      a little salt and pepper, and sear it on a cast-iron skillet or
      grill. Don’t overload this cut with a marinade or souped up
      steak sauce. It’s mild and buttery, so just let the flavor shine
      on its own.

      @@html:<h1>@@Petite Tender@@html:</h1>@@

      You may see this cut listed as teres major or petite tender at
      the butcher, but no matter the name, think these three words:
      cheap hanger steak. Once upon a time, hanger steak made these
      lists of cheap beef cuts because no one knew what that
      incredibly tender cut of beef was. Today, however, the secret is
      out. So the cheaper solution to the once-cheap hanger steak is
      petite tender or teres major.

      This cut of beef acts like a filet mignon: lean, tender, and
      spongy when cooked right. Cut it into medallions and sear like
      filet mignon steaks, or sear the outside in a high-heat skillet
      and roast until medium-rare.

      @@html:<h1>@@Tri-Tip Sirloin@@html:</h1>@@

      This steak comes from a triangle-shaped muscle at the bottom of
      the sirloin. It’s often overlooked because it’s not particularly
      pretty (it doesn’t make consistently-sized steaks), but for the
      person who has no problem finding the beauty in some ugly
      ducklings, this is the steak for you.

      The tri-tip sirloin steak takes well to a marinade and
      grilling. Cook it to medium to help break down some of the
      connective tissue that runs through it, or slice against the
      grain (at least as best you can) to make it more tender.

      @@html:<h1>@@Beef Shank@@html:</h1>@@

      So if you love the flavor of beef short ribs and want them for
      your meals, but loathe the price tag, pick up a pack of beef
      shank (or beef chins) instead.

      These cuts have an incredibly beefy flavor that performs best in
      a long braise. Bonus: look at that marrow-packed bone in each
      cut. That’s a well of rich flavor waiting for your stew or
      roast.

      @@html:<h1>@@Denver Steaks@@html:</h1>@@

      This cut of beef, which comes from the chuck primal cut, is also
      known as the boneless chuck short rib. However, don’t be
      confused—they are not deboned short ribs, and they don’t have to
      be braised. This cut is sometimes tricky for a butcher to get,
      so you may have a hard time finding it.

      These steaks are tender and flavorful, great for grilling or
      slicing for a quick sauté. Slice against the grain to cut
      through some of the marbling and connective tissue. Don’t
      overcook these steaks either. They’ll turn tough in the blink of
      an eye.

      @@html:<h1>@@Merlot@@html:</h1>@@

      The merlot cut comes from the side of the cow’s heel. While
      these hind leg cuts are often very lean (aka tough) because of
      their heavy use, this one manages to be quite tender. Because of
      its stronger flavor but tender texture, this cut is great in
      everything from stir-fries to sheet-pan dinners.

      The merlot cut gets it name from its ruby red color. That’s the
      blood in the cut. Indeed, if you’re blood-averse, avoid this
      cut. Also, don’t overcook the merlot cut. It will very quickly
      produce an irony flavor.
